# baseballaholic-cvc-bot
## Overview
This bot interacts with the Hypixel API to display player statistics from the Cops vs Crims gamemode on Hypixel.
Hypixel is a Java Minecraft server which has dozens of multiplayer games to chose from. 
The bot is currently only in a few servers, most prominently the Competitive CvC (Cops vs Crims) discord server.
The main features of the bot is the ability to check overall stats, individual gamemodes (defusal, tdm, gun game), individual gun stats, and Hypixel CvC Tournament Stats.
To use this bot in a server that it is in, use /cvchelp

### Notes about the development of this bot
This was my first big coding project as well as my first personal project. The code itself isn't terrible as there isn't much room for creativity.
The code is mostly just API calls and embeding an image. I will say, even though the code is ugly the output of the bot is something I'm proud of.
I recently rewrote it to include slash commands to clean up the code and the bot itself, but there is room for improvement
